abstract = {Knowledge discovery in multi-dimensional data is a challenging problem in engineering design. For example, in trade space exploration of large design data sets, designers need to select a subset of data of interest and examine data from different data dimensions and within data clusters at different granularities. This exploration is a process that demands both humans, who can heuristically decide what data to explore and how best to explore it, and computers, which can quickly extract features that may be of interest in the data. Thus, to support this process of knowledge discovery, we need tools that can go beyond traditional computer-oriented optimisation approaches and support advanced designer-centred trade space exploration and data interaction. This paper is an effort to address this need. In particular, we propose the interactive multiscale-nested clustering and aggregation framework to support trade space exploration of multi-dimensional data common to design optimisation.

It is an open source portable library capable of handling huge graphs with millions of vertices and edges and it is also suitable to grid computing. It contains routines for creating, manipulating and visualizing networks, calculating various structural properties, importing from and exporting to various file formats and many more. Via its interfaces to high-level languages like GNU R and Python it supports rapid development and fast prototyping.},

@article{Mitra2010,
abstract = {What and how much can children learn without subject teachers? In an attempt to find a limit to self organized learning, we explored the capacity of 10-14 year old Tamil-speaking children in a remote Indian village to learn basic molecular biology, initially on their own with a Hole-in-the-Wall public computer facility, and later with the help of a mediator without knowledge of this subject. We then compared these learning outcomes with those of similarly-aged children at a nearby average-below average performing state government school who were not fluent in English but were taught this subject and another group of children at a high-performing private school in New Delhi who were fluent in English and had been taught this subject by qualified teachers. We found that the village children who only had access to computers and Internet-based resources in the Hole-in-the-Wall learning stations achieved test scores comparable with those at the local state school and, with the support of the mediator, equal to their peers in the privileged private urban school. Further experiments were conducted with unsupervised groups of 8-12 year-olds in several English schools using the Internet to study for GCSE questions they normally would be examined on at the age of 16. We conclude that, in spite of some limitations, there are opportunities for self-organised and mediated learning by children in settings where they would otherwise be denied opportunities for good, or indeed any, schooling. We also show that this approach can be enhanced by the use of local or online mediators.},

Indeed this form of self-instruction has produced hackersâ€” children who can penetrate high tech security systems. Is this kind of learning dependent only on the availability of technology? We provided slum children in New Delhi with Internet access in their settlement. The paper describes the results obtained in the first month of unsupervised and unguided access. It is observed that children seem to understand and use the technology fluently. Language and formal education do not seem to make any significant difference.},
